### About me:
I was lucky to find early what I love to do. Since I was 10 years old, I never said goodbye to the computer. He started his career in IT with a job in a service center. There he acquired the skills of working with clients, organizations, got acquainted with computer hardware. Later he entered the Brest State Technical University (BSTU). After graduating with a degree in Automated Information Processing Systems. After working for a few more years in the service center, I moved to a confectionery factory where I work as a System Administrator. Developing skills, I became interested in building websites. So I began to get acquainted with the world of Frontend. I keep learning and learning new things.
